# lab1CalculatorExprCompuse.java - Java and Git
Basic calculator for mathematical expressions in Java with JFrame interface.

# lab2 - GraalVM
An example of a polyglot program with GraalVM. A polyglot program is a program that contains code in different programming languages. 
GraalVM must be imported for the program to work.

# lab3 - ADT(Algebraic Data Types) in Kotlin
A simple regex program for deleting multiple spaces, backspace or the index page.

# lab4 - SOLID Principles
*S*ingle responsibility principle
*O*pen/closed principle
*L*iskov substitution principle
*I*nterface segregation principle
*D*ependency inversion principle

## Pb1
A web crawler implemented with khttp and Jsoup. A web crawler (also called a spider or bot) is a program that automatically browses the internet and collects information from websites.

## Pb2
An app for buying tickets at a cinema built with SOLID principles in mind.

## Pb3
A simple to-do app based on SOLID principles.

# lab7 - Collections & generics in Kotlin
## MainLab.kt
A program that processes all the entries from /var/log/syslog (main system log file on Linux systems) from the last 30 minutes.

## MainTema.kt
A program that processes the last 50 lines from /var/log/apt/history.log (the file which records the history of package management operations on Debian-based Linux systems (like Ubuntu)).

# lab8 - Design Patterns in Kotlin
## tema1
An app that that calculates the exit of a logical AND gate with 2, 3, 4 and 8 inputs.

## tema2
Browser with parental controls that combines three design patterns: the Prototype pattern for generating standard requests, the Proxy pattern for filtering HTTP GET requests, and the Facade pattern for delivering a streamlined user interface.

# lab10 - Corutines
All the apps were made just for academic purpose, using Kotlin coroutines, Java BlockingQueue and Java Executors.

## p2-1
Demonstration of the pipeline pattern using Kotlin coroutines and channels to process vectors across sequential stages.

## p2-2
Equivalent vector processing pipeline implemented with traditional Java threading and BlockingQueue mechanisms.

## p3-1
Illustration of race conditions that occur when coroutines modify shared data structures without synchronization safeguards.

## p3-2
Properly synchronized producer-consumer implementation using Java's LinkedBlockingQueue.

## p4-1
File reader built with Kotlin coroutines and appropriate I/O dispatchers for asynchronous operations.

## p4-2
Concurrent file reading solution using Java's fixed thread pool executor.

## p5-1
Web scraping pipeline built with Kotlin coroutine actors that downloads pages, parses content, and renders DOM trees.

## p5-2
Three-stage web processing pipeline implemented with Java threads and blocking queues

# lab12 - Functional Programming 
Functional programming is a paradigm where the emphasis is placed on transforming data with expressions (ideally, these expressions should have no side effects).

## p1
Function that applies sequential transformations to an integer list and computes the final sum.

## p2
Selective Caesar cipher implementation that encrypts file contents based on specific criteria.

## p3
Polygon perimeter calculator that first orders points in clockwise or counter-clockwise sequence before measuring distances.

## p4
Demonstration of functor-like operations applied to map structures and string manipulations.
